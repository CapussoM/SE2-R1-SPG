### QUALITY MEASURES

#### Testing:

In this sprint we have added some other backend tests to the many that we already have in order to improve the coverage on code. We also thoroughly tested the web application manually. This took a total of around 9hrs that we first estimated as 8.

#### Code review:

This time this task was kind of merged with the “Testing” task, because every instance of code review involved a lot of manual testing. 

#### Technical Debt management:

We planned 10 hours of bug fixing but actually we spent 12 hours to fix all the present bugs. For this sprint we did not assign time for the fix of sonarqube issues but the last sprint we have dedicated few hours to fix all the code smells and bugs.

#### SonarQube ratings

|   **Reliability**   |         C - 78 bugs          |
| :-----------------: | :--------------------------: |
| **Maintainability** |   **A - 185 Code Smells**    |
|    **Security**     |  **A - 0 Vulnerabilities**   |
| **Security Review** | **D - 42 Security Hotspots** |

### ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

It was the last sprint so we couldn’t delay anything. Some core tasks required a little more time to be perfectly completed without any bugs and we feared going out of time budget. Fortunately, efficient communication led us to properly manage that.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

From this sprint we learnt that dealing with bugs and making everything work well can take a very big amount of time and in fact we planned to dedicate this sprint mainly to bug fixing and to improve the already present features in terms of reliability and performance. Sometimes it is better to not develop many new functionalities but improve the already present ones in order to not make them more resistant to bugs.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

In this sprint we managed to have better communication and we managed to work all together a lot, we had more frequent calls and more exchange of opinions which helped out a lot in the development.

- Which ones were you not able to achieve? Why?

In this sprint we achieved pretty much what we aimed to do, either with the implementation of the new features and the fix of many functional issues.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

There will be no next sprint, but as a team we still have to improve our coordination a little more even if this time everything went smoothly. 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Everyone managed to accomplish 100% of his tasks for this sprint, we worked strictly together and in continuous communication more than every other week and we successfully achieved a wonderful project, presentation and video.
We were happy and proud to have built a platform with documentation, telegram bot etc.. like this!
