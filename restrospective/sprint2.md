- Hours per task (average, standard deviation) 


​       7.5 on average per story, 5 per task. Standard deviation per story: 10.07

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table

  51/60 = 0.8

### QUALITY MEASURES

#### Testing:

A total of 6 hours was estimated for the testing in general, both unit and E2E plus the sonarcloud implementation. In reality, a total of 7 hours and 30 minutes were spent, achieving a total of 62% coverage.

#### Code review:

Estimated a total of 2 and a half hours, which corresponds to the total of time spent.

#### Technical Debt management:

First of all, we had a big debt regarding the code organization that needed a full rework. This was estimated to take 4hrs, that in reality took 3 and a half. While doing the rework, some remediation suggested by SonarQube was done, but some other was added as the features were developed. This is still something to look at for the next sprint.

#### SonarQube ratings

| **Reliability**     | **C -- 39 bugs**              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Maintainability** | **A -- 56 code smells**       |
| **Security**        | **A -- 0 vulnerabilities**    |
| **Security Review** | **E -- 29 security hotspots** |

### ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

One of the tasks we underestimated, which made us have to postpone a couple stories.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

With a good base and team organization you go way faster, so it’s better to invest a little more time into planning and discussion than just throwing code. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

We successfully achieved a better division of the tasks and stories, plus we were able to meet more often and that boosted up our efficiency.

- Which ones were you not able to achieve? Why?

We managed to achieve all our set goals from the last retrospective.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

For the next sprint we need to maintain the previous team coordination and we have to switch more between frontend and backend. Switching will be the key of the next sprint because the parts are STRICTLY connected, more than before.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

During this sprint we worked better together, divided the tasks better and managed to accomplish almost everything that we had planned.
